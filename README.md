  - custom properties
  - pseudo-classes
  - pseudo-elements
  - CSS sprite
  - flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Even if I did not feel I spent too much time carrying out this challenge, I still have to learn about how to make front-end development in a more efficient way and to learn to manage to build web pages without seeming to be too slow.
